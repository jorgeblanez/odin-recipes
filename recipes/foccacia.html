    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>500g of all-purpose flour;</li>
            <li>300g of room-temperature water;</li>
            <li>10g of instant yeast;</li>
            <li>6g of fine sea salt;</li>
            <li>50g of extra virgin olive oil;</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>In a bowl, add the flour, yeast and salt;</li>
            <li>Mix together until homogenous;</li>
            <li>Slowly mix together the water, until a wet dough is formed;</li>
            <li>If the dough is dry, add a little more water (10g at a time);</li>
            <li>While mixing, add the olive oil until homogenous;</li>
            <li>Once a wet dough is formed, and all olive oil was used, let the dough rest for 10 minutes;</li>
            <li>in intervals of 15 minutes, perform a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYzxulQY1Gc">stretch and folds</a>, for a total of 4 times;</li>
            <li>After the last stretch and fold, pour the dough in a sheet pan with olive oil in the bottom;</li>
            <li>Add olive oil to the top of the dough, and let it rise, anywhere from 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled and bubbly;</li>
            <li>With the tip of your fingers, press the dough forming a wavy surface;</li>
            <li>Put it in a pre-heated oven at 230Â°C, for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown in the top and cooked all the way through</li>
            <li>Take it out of the oven, and let it rest until cooled (if you can resist it)</li>
            <li>Enjoy ;)</li>
